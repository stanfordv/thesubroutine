      The modern world is made up of ones and zeros; a digital true and false or
      good and evil. Throughout the cloud a matrix has formed combining each of
      these binaries to allow nuance and discussion to take place among the
      masses. A bird needs both its left and right wing to fly. However, dark
      and powerful forces have formed to take control of the matrix for their
      own personal gain. They electrify the matrix with shame, fear and paranoia
      to force people into staying quiet and taking sides against each other
      while the truely wicked get away with the most gruesom crimes.
      <p /> <br />
      Legend has it that deep in the matrix, an small, unmonitored but very
      effective subroutine exists like a hidden bunker off the radar. This
      subroutine, if activated and allowed to grow, could challenge these dark
      forces and return balance to the matrix. The legend contends that there is
      a specific code needed to access this subroutine, but no one has ever seen
      it. Two explorers, Larry Contrary and Rasmus Modsat, while looking for a
      way to escape the oppression of the matrix may have stumbled upon this
      code and are likely in full control of the subroutine.
      <p />
      <br /> The Subroutine is a underground bunker wedged deep inside the
      matrix and preparing for the next beast of wave to come crashing through
      the system. It is currently manned by Larry Contray and Rasmus Modest,
      together with their trusty AI. <p /> <br />
      When they finally made their in, they cleared the system cache, updated
      the dependcies and they found a way to rewire the look of the entire
      subroutine's{" "}

      <p /> <br /> They recognize scales of corruption. There is a corruption
      staring at them from within themselves but also through their neighbors,
      their politicians, major corporation, ngos, and forever into the AI. It
      sits in them like a disease.
